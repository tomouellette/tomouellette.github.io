Currently, I am focused on the fusion of evolutionary biology, synthetic data, and learning algorithms for applications in cancer genomics and somatic evolution. In addition, I have a modestly new but growing interest in immunotherapy, tumour neoantigens, and general immuno-oncology. Random growth on a 2-dimensional grid Previously, I received my BSc (Hons.) in Pharmacology at the University of British Columbia (UBC). While at UBC, I developed computational methods for identifying pharmacogenomic relevent genetic variation with Bruce Carleton at BC Children's Hospital Research Institute (BCCHRI) and, additionally, worked on methods for interrogating genome evolution and pleiotropy in plants with the Keith Adams at the Biodiversity Research Centre . I also dabbled a bit in quantifying the pharmacodynamic properties of analgesics with Michael Walker in the Department of Anesthesiology, Pharmacology, and Therapeutics .
