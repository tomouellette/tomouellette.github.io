Importantly, anoikis is critical to normal tissue homeostasis. If tumorigenic mutations arise, anoikis can fail and detached cells can proliferate and survive, thus supporting negative events such as metastatic spread (this brief review covers the role of anoikis in malignancy). In terms of morphology, detachment generally leads to loss of standard cellular form, causing cells to round and form dynamic surface blebs. (Supplementary Video 1)</p> <p> Supplementary Video. This video from Weems et al.

Weems et al. attempted to address this question by focusing on melanoma cells, which are known to be highly invasive and metastatic. </p> <p>One of the major challenges of showing the importance of blebs in driving malignancy is that they are dynamic and and often cyclical, transient states. To overcome this, the authors used a combination of 3D imaging and manipulation of cell morphological states with well-thought out pharmacological agents to understand how blebs trigger the formation of plasma-membrane proximal signalling hubs which promote anoikis resistance. Notably, they first used wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a lectin, to crosslink components of the glycocalyx which ultimately reduces plasma membrane deformability. Thus, WGA should act as a dose-dependent inhibitor of the bleb density on single-cell surfaces.</p> <p>To finally test the theory that preventing blebs should lead to suppression of anoikis resistance, Weems et al. performed dose-response survival analysis on 3 melanoma cell lines: MV3 (NRAS-driven), A375 (BRAF-driven), and M498 (BRAF-driven primary cell line) (Figure 1). They found that WGA treatment significantly reduced the survival of detached cells, but had little effect on well-adhered cells. This suggests that blebs are important for anoikis resistance in detached cells, but not in well-adhered cells. In addition, pre-stressing cell lines by growing them to over-confluence increased the sensitivity of detached bleb cells to WGA. Importantly, they performed follow-up experiments using VitroGel coffins to show that WGA is actually targeting blebs and not an off-target effect (see their paper for more details).</p> <p></p> <p> Figure. The authors measured the fraction of cells dead (relative to controls) in detached and adherent cells with blebs. Detached cells with blebs were significantly more sensitive to WGA then adherent cells (panel a). Additionally, WGA treatment reduced the intracellular curvature of detached bleb cells, suggesting the increase in death was a by-product of reduction in dynamic bleb structure </p> <p>While this initial analysis revealed the importance of blebs, it did not explain how blebs promote anoikis resistance.

This video from Weems et al. (2023) shows septins pulsing at the location of surface blebs</p> <p>The authors noted that blebbed cells have drastically increased plasma membrane curvature to bleb-inhibited cells. When analyzing the curvature more deeply they found notable recruitment of septins to the bleb edges/pockets (see their Extended Data Figure 2. While GFP probes showed evidence of septin localization, the authors further confirmed this through 3-dimensional time-lapse imaging. They found that septin proteins were recruited to the edges of blebs, and that this recruitment was dependent on the bleb curvature.</p> <p>Supplementary Video. This video from Weems et al.

Septins had the highest intensity in regions with higher curvature, i.e. in edges of pockets (panel c). Septins were found to be concetrated on the edges of surface blebs - concentrations decrease rapidly as you move away from edge but remained elevated in the pocket and not on top of bleb (panel e). Application of multiple bleb modulators or inhibitors impact septin localization in the cortical cell space (panel g and f). As well, each condition showed a strong linear relationship between septin-recruiting plasma curvature and cortical septin levels (panel h). To ensure that bleb curvature was responsible for septin localization, they generated septin mutants lacking the carboxy-terminal amphipathic helix necessary for curvature sensing by septins \u2014 deletion of this helix prevented localization suggesting bleb curvature was driving septin localization (panel i). Gross septin localization was stable on timescale of minutes even though blebs only lasted 60seconds at a time (panel j). Time-lapse light-sheet microscopy was used to show that pulses of septin accumulation appear on curvy bases of blebs but dissipate when curves subside \u2014 found that more dynamic bleb regions had more frequent septin concentration shifts and the shifts occurred at faster rates \u2014 whereas in areas with low rates of septin concetration change there was slower change \u2014 overall indicating two septin populations on the cell surface with dynamic pools in positive curvature and stable pools which were less reliant on local curvature (panel k). </p>","tags":["Blebs","Anoikis","Oncogenic signaling","Melanoma","Morphology"]},{"location":"blog/2023/Blebbing%20the%20way%20to%20resistance/#septins-are-needed-for-anoikis-resistance","title":"Septins are needed for anoikis resistance","text":"<p>Given the relationship between bleb formation and septin localization, the authors wanted to determine if septins were necessary for any form of bleb-dependent anoikis resistance. To evaluate this question, they directly tested if bleb-associated septin structures regulate survival signalling by measuring anoikis resistance subject to treatment with septin inhibitor forchlorfenuron (FCF). FCF treatment resulted in near-complete ablation of cortical septin structures, and FCF disrupted anoikis resistance in MV3, M498, and MAPKi-challenged A375 cells (mirroring bleb inhibition results). This suggests that septins are necessary for bleb-dependent anoikis resistance. They also tested if septins were necessary for anoikis resistance in general, and found that FCF treatment did not disrupt anoikis resistance in cells that did not septin localization in blebs (i.e. A375 cells). This suggests that septins are only necessary for anoikis resistance in cells with blebs.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure.

They first performed BioID using the septin protein (SEPT6) as a bait. Overall, they obtained 321 septin-interacting proteins with 3 plasma-membrance localizing proteins, namely Notch, CD44, and NRAS. Given the juxtracrine relationship between Notch and CD44, they focused on NRAS. Importantly, further examination of pulldown data showed that NRAS interacted with SEPT6 in MV3 and prestressed A375, but not in unperturbed A375 cells. This is an important observation because, as noted above, A375 cells don't have septin recruitment with bleb formation which indicates that the NRAS\u2013septin interaction depends on the assembly of bleb-nucleated septin structures. This relationship was further substantiated through live-cell imaging of round, detached cells where NRAS-SEPT6 interaction was found.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure. Septins scaffold NRAS which promotes NRAS-MAPK and NRAS-PI3K survival signalling.

Authors measured how septin inhibition affects NRAS localization using earth mover\u2019s distance \u2014 computed EMD using a homogenous distribution of same amount of signal as a reference - found that septin-inhibited cells produced lower EMD values, suggesting diffuse signal distributions relative to unperturbed cells (panel b).

MV cells, MV3 cells with dominant-negative SEPT2 mutant (that causes loss of septin activity), and MV3 cells with Vitrogel coffins were detached or adhered for 3 hours --- detachment of inhibited cells caused no change in ERK activation whereas septin and bleb inhibition caused marked reduction in ERK activation, thus BLEBs and SEPTINs required to maintain ERK signalling in detached cells (panel d).
