My research focuses on the fusion of evolutionary biology, synthetic data, learning algorithms, and computer vision for applications in cancer omics' and somatic evolution.   Previously, I received my BSc in Pharmacology at the University of British Columbia (UBC) where I worked on developing computational methods for identifying pharmacogenomic relevent genetic variation with Bruce Carleton at BC Children's Hospital Research Institute (BCCHRI) and for interrogating genome evolution and pleiotropy in plants with Keith Adams at the Biodiversity Research Centre. I also dabbled a bit in quantifying the pharmacodynamic properties of analgesics with Michael Walker in the Department of Anesthesiology, Pharmacology, and Therapeutics.   <p>For questions, collaboration, or scientific discussion, feel free to reach out</p> <p> tom.ouellette [at] mail.utoronto.ca </p>"},{"location":"contact/","title":"contact","text":""},{"location":"contact/#_1","title":"contact","text":"<p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>For questions, collaboration, or scientific discussion, feel free to reach out</p> <p> tom.ouellette [at] mail.utoronto.ca </p>"},{"location":"pubs/","title":"publications","text":""},{"location":"pubs/#publications","title":"Publications","text":"<p>  For a full list of publications, please check out Google Scholar.  </p>"},{"location":"pubs/#selected-publications","title":"Selected publications","text":"<p>      Understanding the evolution of tumours using hybrid deep generative models      AI for Science Workshop, International Conference on Machine Learning (2022) Tom W.
